DATA ANALYST CAPSTONE PROJECT (BANKING)
For this project, I utilised computer programs to examine banking data closely and identify functional patterns
First, I ensured the information was accurate by verifying that it was complete and free from errors and inconsistencies.
Then, I analysed the various types of information in the data, including customer habits and key trends, and presented these findings using easy-to-understand charts. 
After that, I took additional steps to verify that all parts of the data were accurate and precise. Using visual tools, I spotted connections and patterns between different pieces of information. 
I also compared groups within the data to see how they affected the primary outcome we wanted to predict. Finally, I tested and refined a model to predict future results, ensuring my predictions were as reliable as possible. 
Python was the primary programming language used for this project. I imported the Pandas library and conducted an exploratory data analysis to assess the dataset. 
This included identifying and addressing missing values, as well as checking for and handling duplicate records.
I examined unique values within the target variables, calculated their counts, and analysed the distribution of the target variable. 
I performed both univariate and bivariate analyses, created relevant visualisations, and carried out logistic regression as specified in the project requirements.
Thanks to these steps, I was able to uncover insights that can help banks make better decisions.
